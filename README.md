# Simple Notes App
This is a simple notes app built with React and Django.

## Problem statement task
<br>
The project aims to deploy this web application using Docker Swarm, an efficient container orchestration tool that simplifies the management and scaling of containerized applications. In this project I had created a Dockerfile to package the Django-app into a container and deploying it onto a Docker Swarm cluster. The Swarm cluster was configured to provide automated failover, load balancing, and horizontal scaling, showcasing the advantages of Docker Swarm for production deployments.


## Credits
I would like to credit Saurabh Dahibhate for the original project idea that inspired my work on this project.
